The proposed system helps in identification of Leaf blight and provides remedies that can be used as a 
defense mechanism against the blight. The database obtained from the Internet is properly segregated 
and the different leaf species are identified and are renamed to form a proper database then obtain testdatabase which consists of various Leaf blights that are used for checking the accuracy and confidence
